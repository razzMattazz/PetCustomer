What kind of job am I looking for?
	I'm just looking for something that will challenge me enough. I don't want something easy. I want something that will make me feel stupid because that is when I do my best. That is what makes me obsess and skip sleep and gives me the stress that feels so great once it is relieved. Once that switch has clicked in my head and it all becomes so clear. It just makes feel like I kicked ass and that's the feeling that makes me enjoy coding so much.


What do I currently do?
	I manage the kitchen at a Mellow Mushroom. It's a very fast-paced job with a lot of the same challenges every day. Every now and then I get a new challenge though. Something breaks. Someone doesn't show. Outta hamburgers. As intense as it can get on a busy night, it's not very exciting anymore. There's not more responsibility or pay to be gotten, so even if I weren't beginning my new career, I think I'd be ready to move on to something bigger.


What sets me apart from other applicants?
	The nagging voice in my head that takes over when something isnt perfect. The same thing that, when I was getting my degree, drove me to pull all nighters just to make an A+ project come up to my standards. No exceptions. No errors. No user input can stop my programs.
	Thats why I can take credit for every bit of code from my semester long group project. Because when other members would be happy that their code did the task that we needed. I would be the one who innevitably broke it and then fixed it.
